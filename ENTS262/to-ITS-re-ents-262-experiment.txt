Hi Doog, Rich, and Dave,

Tom Baraniak has created an outdoor thermal insulation experiment (for
Prof. Melissa Eblen-Zayas's ENTS-262 class) with thermal sensors that
feed into one of these Analog Data Acquisition Modules:

    http://www.controlbyweb.com/analog/

The DAQ module makes the data available via a mini-web server over an
ethernet port.

Tom plans to site the experiment near the Telescope Pedestals located
outside and to the East of Goodsell 104 because these pedestals
already have power and ethernet ports.

Melissa wants the experment to be operations by the "middle of next
week" (1/30).


Port activation (DOOG):

    The Ethernet ports on Telescope Pedestals 2, 3, 4 are all inactive
    or possibly non-functional.  I tried plugging a laptop into them a
    few hours ago and got no signal.  Since these ports are exposed the
    elements 24/365, I wouldn't be surprised to disover that some of
    them just don't work anymore.

    Doog, could you activate and test Telescope Pedestals 2, 3, and 4?

    BTW, Cindy Blaha, who uses these ethernet ports the most, says
    they can be flaky in the winter.  Tom says he'd be happy to
    discuss the topic more robust weatherproof ethernet access ports
    with you as a mid to longterm solution.


Assigning a hostname and IP address:

    Rich and Dave,

    I'm happy to make a DHCP assignment myself but I need to know what
    hostname I should give it.  Is there naming convention for such
    devices?
    
    FWIW, the DAQ Modules Macaddr is: 00:0C:C8:02:81:F1


Security implications:

    Rich and Dave,

    I'm not sure what the security implications are for having this
    thing sit on our network.  I do know that Tom has changed the
    default admin pw for the device.
