Hi Tom,

[Update: I checked the timeout threshold value -- It's set to 1.0s, not
0.1s as I had earlier stated.  That's a pretty high threshold, so I
didn't change it...]

A few weeks back I recoded my insolation data gathering script to be
tolerant of timeout events when talking to the insolation expermiments
web page.  Before I made that fix, a timeout event caused the script
to fail and no data would be collected for the rest of the day, which
was bad.  Now the script captures each timeout event and and logs it
to a separate file.

Here's a listing of the number of timeout events per day since I
started logging them:

sol:Digests phasadmin$ wc *.err
       3 2014-03-05-digest.err
       7 2014-03-06-digest.err
       9 2014-03-07-digest.err
     277 2014-03-08-digest.err
       3 2014-03-09-digest.err
       4 2014-03-10-digest.err
       0 2014-03-11-digest.err
    8292 2014-03-12-digest.err
    6089 2014-03-13-digest.err
      52 2014-03-14-digest.err
      87 2014-03-15-digest.err
       1 2014-03-16-digest.err
       7 2014-03-17-digest.err

As you can see, some days are much worse than others.  I suspect
there's a bad ethernet connection, that's exacerbated by weather
somehow.
