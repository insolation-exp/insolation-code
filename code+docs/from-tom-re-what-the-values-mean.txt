Bruce,

Here is more information about which box has what insulation.  getting
good data now.

Input 0/3 is R3 no window

Input 1/4 is the window

Input 2/5 is R5

Input 6 is outdoor temperature

Input 7 is solar output in watts/meter squared.  Need to multiply the
value displayed by 910 to get the actual value.  During the day it
should be hundreds of watts depending on sunlight.
